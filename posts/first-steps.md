As with many others, my introduction to technology was at a young age. I remember seeing my first computer in grade school, sitting in class, watching the teacher enter data. Once getting to sit at the keyboard, getting to play **Reader Rabbit** and **Super Solvers: Gizmos and Gadgets!**, I was hooked. I always wanted to be close to the computer.

Fast forward to the **MySpace** era, and almost everyone I knew was learning basic **HTML and CSS** to add personalization to their pages. We all had songs, background images, even some going as far as adding the worst animations that I can remember. During this time, my enthusiasm for computers never waivered it was just redirected to **gaming**. As I got older, that hobbiest mentality lead me to wanting to learn more, thinking that networking may align more with the way my mind functioned. I learned very quickly that the logical foundation of **programming** was what I was looking for, but not the focus in networking logic. I wanted to build applications, websites, and be able to do so from scratch.

Utilizing my miltary benefits, I chose to pursue a path that would allow me to learn to be a **full stack developer**, which at the time I was not even sure what the role fully entailed. In the **VetTech Program**, I found that I could use my benefits to enroll in a bootcamp that taught me the correct way to learn to be a developer. The bootcamp taught **React.js, ASP.Net, .Net Core, SQL**, how to think programmatically, and to read documentation. While attending the bootcamp, I got to work with an amazing group of developers on a **Minimum Viable Product** for an interesting startup.
