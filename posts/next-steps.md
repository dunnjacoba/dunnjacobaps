This is my experience journey, so far, has been one that I believe may resonate with others. **Disclaimer: this is my personal experience and in no way references any others opinions or is reflective of any business | individual**

I began my first attempt at learning a technology focus, when I enrolled in ITT Tech for graphic design. As someone who was always artistic, I thought that that would be a great marriage of my interests, Technology and Art. We all know the story of ITT, and how they closed permanently in 2016 due to all the awful practices they embodied. That experience really created a negative impression about anything technology centric and it would be years before I began looking into the field on a professional level again. These years consisted of me going into the military, working in various fields, taking on management rolls, and broadening my experiences with interpersonal interactions and perspective.

After all the years in positions that I did not find any joy or enthusiasm for, I decided that I needed to get back to technology professionally. I knew that I would need the structured learning environment that I would not be able to provide myself at home.
The military offers resources to help further the individuals, and I took complete advantage of this. The technology resources that I dived into, VETTECH, offered a list of bootcamps and other higher education venues. I choose the one that was offering a full stack program and that had good reviews. While attending the bootcamp, **React.js, JavaScript, .Net, ASP, C#, SQL, RESTful APIs** were the focus of the curriculum.
