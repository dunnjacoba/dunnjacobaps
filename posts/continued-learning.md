The transition into the field of software development has been an interesting journey. The aspect that draws me further into the field, and maintains my enticement, is that of the continuous changes and opportunities to keep **learning** new skills. Applying the skills learned when building a **site, database, middleware or commiting meaningful additions** to a repo are the most fulfilling experiences so far in this endeavor.

Whether building a **Minimally Viable Product** in a team, or a **Single Page Application** as a personal site, implementing **JavaScript or TypeScript** or simply reading others submitted code from pull requests on **GitHub** learning is a daily occurence. I was fortunate enough to catch a Twitter Space today that described **JavaScript** as a paint and developers as artists. I found this analogy interestingly astute, as everyone has their own take on writing **JavaScript**. I also gleaned this great tidbit: **"Tech is not easy, at first it can be difficult , but with time gets easier. Anyone can do this, but the work to excel differs for everyone."**
